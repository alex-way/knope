# Add `get-version` default workflow

For **single-package repositories** with no custom workflows defined,
there is now a [default workflow](https://knope.tech/reference/default-config/#workflows) called `get-version` that 
prints out the current package version.

If you want similar functionality for multi-package repositories, please add your ideas to [issue #988](https://github.com/knope-dev/knope/issues/988).

Thanks to @BatmanAoD for the suggestion and @alex-way for the implementation!

PR #994 closed #885.
